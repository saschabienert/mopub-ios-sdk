You'll need to install the Xcoverage plugin to see code coverage in Xcode. I recommend using [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/), an Xcode package manager, to do so. NB: You'll need to restart Xcode to pick up the new plugin.

Once you've done that, you can run tests and see coverage by doing View > Xcoverage > Show Coverage.

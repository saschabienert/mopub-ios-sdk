Heyzap iOS SDK
=======

Integrating the SDK
----
Heyzap is still hosting its SDK at https://developers.heyzap.com/docs. If you're looking to integrate ads, we suggest downloading our SDK rather than building from source.


Building from Source
--------------------
You may want to contribute features, fix bugs, or just poke around the source code of our SDK. To build, open the `Heyzap/Heyzap.xcworkspace` file, choose the HeyzapSDKTest target, and click run.

If you spot a bug, or have trouble integrating the SDK, [open an Issue on Github](https://github.com/Heyzap/ios-sdk/issues).

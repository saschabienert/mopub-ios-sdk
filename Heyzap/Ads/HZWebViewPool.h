// This Web view pool serves two purposes:
// First, initializing the first webview takes 31â€“42 ms; it takes something like 11ms for subsequent initializations. By initializing the pool when the SDK is started (before gameplay happens), we avoid taking a 40ms hit when we can't afford it (during 60 FPS gameplay).

// Second, we avoid the 11ms cost later by giving back a cached web view.

// Currently this class is only being used for the preloadWebViews. They're the only thing that was causing performance problems and they're the safest place to do this.

// This class could probably be generalized to other objects, with blocks to initialize the object and sanitize the returned object.
